-OBJECTIVE
 The objective of the game is to bid correctly on the number of tricks that a player will take in the subsequent round of play.
 Points are awarded for a correct bid and subtracted for an incorrect bid.
 The player with most points after all rounds have been played is the winner.
-GAMEPLAY
 In the first round every player gets one card.
 In the subsequent rounds the number of cards is increased by one until all cards are distributed.
 The top card of the remaining cards is turned over to determine the trump suit.
 (If there are no cards left or a jester is turned there is no trump suit only the wizards are trump.
 If a wizard is turned the dealer picks a trump suit.)
 The player to the left of the dealer plays a card and then the others follow clockwise.
 If a card other than a wizard or jester is played the players have to follow suit,
 but it is possible to play a jester or wizard although the player has the desired suit.
 The Wizard beats all other cards but the first one in a trick beats all others.
 The jester is beaten by all others, but if all cards in a trick are jesters the first one beats the others.
 If a jester is played as the first card the first suit card decides which suit has to be followed.
 If a wizard is played as the first card every player is free to play what they want regardless of the others.
